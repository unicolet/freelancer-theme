                        Know in near real time what is happening inside your middleware(s): messages, events, channel statistics, errors.
                        Extract daily statistics from the embedded http engine to implement proactive monitoring with any tool.

                    <p>
                        Middleware Insight uses the award winning <a href="https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch">Elasticsearch</a> engine for storing data and can scale vertically and horizontally to support
                        any load.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Searching and aggregating across days of data is instantaneous and Middleware Insight can help reduce the load on the middleware persistence layer.
